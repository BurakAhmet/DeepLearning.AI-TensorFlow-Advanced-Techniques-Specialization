## About This Specialization
  In this Specialization, you will expand your knowledge of the Functional API and build exotic non-sequential model types. You will learn how to optimize training in different environments with multiple processors and chip types and get introduced to advanced computer vision scenarios such as object detection, image segmentation, and interpreting convolutions. You will also explore generative deep learning including the ways AIs can create new content from Style Transfer to Auto Encoding, VAEs, and GANs.

You’ll take a peek at what graph code looks like, and you’ll practice generating this more efficient code automatically with TensorFlow’s tools, so that you don’t have to write the graph code yourself!
   
    * <b>[Week 4 - Distributed Training](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/4.%20Distributed%20Training)</b>: You will harness the power of distributed training to process more data and train larger models, faster. You’ll get an overview of various distributed training strategies and then practice working with two strategies, one that trains on multiple GPU cores, and the other that trains on multiple TPU cores.

      * <b>[Week 3 - Image Segmentation](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/3.%20Advanced%20Computer%20Vision%20with%20TensorFlow/3.%20Image%20Segmentation)</b>: This week is all about image segmentation using variations of the fully convolutional neural network. With these networks, you can assign class labels to each pixel, and perform much more detailed identification of objects compared to bounding boxes. You’ll build the fully convolutional neural network, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN this week to identify and detect numbers, pets, and even zombies!
   
      * <b>[Week 4 - Visualization and Interpretability](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/3.%20Advanced%20Computer%20Vision%20with%20TensorFlow/4.%20Visualization%20and%20Interpretability)</b>: You’ll learn about the importance of model interpretability, which is the understanding of how your model arrives at its decisions. You’ll also implement class activation maps, saliency maps, and gradient-weighted class activation maps to identify which parts of an image are being used by your model to make its predictions. You’ll also see an example of how visualizing a model’s intermediate layer activations can help to improve the design of a famous network, AlexNet.
